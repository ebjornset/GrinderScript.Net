Properties used by GrinderScript.Net
=================

This page contains a summary of all the properties used by GrinderScript.Net. You use these in addition to the normal Grinder properties. 

Some tips & tricks before you begin
------------------

1. To start using GrinderScript.Net with Grinder you must specify the assembly containing your load tests in the **grinder.script** property. Please remember to include the **.dll** extension, otherwise Grinder will not bind your script to GrinderScript.Net, e.g. `grinder.script=GrinderScript.Net.Verifier.dll`
2. Please note that GrinderScript.Net requires that you use the DCR instrumentation engine in Grinder. Make sure the property `grinder.dcrinstrumentation=true` is present in your `grinder.properties` file, and everything will be fine.
3. Remember to use \\\\ (two backslashes) when you specify a path separator in a property.
4. The properties with **None** as the *Default value* in the table below are mandatory, the rest are optional. 
5. It's recommended that you use an assembly qualified type name for type name properties, to make sure GrinderScript.Net can find and load the type from this symbolic name.
6. These properties are plain Java properties, so you must specify them using the normal Java property format, see this [.properties file](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.properties "Wikipedia: .properties") description if you\'re in doubt.
7. Property names are case sensitive.
8. If you specify the same property several times the last line wins.
8. You can use [these properties](./grinder.properties "Starting point for your grinder.properties") as a starting point for your own *grinder.properties* file.
9. The Grinder does not require you to name your `grinder.properties` file *grinder.properties*, its just the default name used until you override it. You can select any property file in The Grinder Console, or specify a file name as an option in your Grinder Agent start up script. See [The Grinder user documentation](http://grinder.sourceforge.net/g3/manual.html "The Grinder's Complete User Guide") for further details.

On the other hand this can cause a huge startup overhead if your setup contains a lot of content. If you specify "grinderscript-dotnet.binFolder", GrinderScript.Net will look for assemblies in that folder in addition to The Grinder's Worker process active folder. The worker process's active folder is checked first, then the folder you specify. This property is optional.</td>

This property controls how many separate test calls is performed pr iteration. Playing with this property will give you a feeling about the overhead of calling back and forth between Java and the CLR. When using the default value of 1, each Grinder iteration will just cause one call from the CLR back to the JVM. In this setup the overhead of the initial Grinder call from the JVM to the CLE will have a huge impact on the number of TPS. Setting this to a higher value will reduce this impact and will give you n indication about the maximum load you will be able to generate.</td>
