[GrinderScript.Net](http://grinderscript.net "GrinderScript.Net official homepage") is an [open source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source_software "Wikipedia: Open-source software") project licensed under the [Apache License 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html "Apache License 2.0").

The idea for this project was born when the company I'm working for decided to use The Grinder as the preferred load test framework. It is currenlty developed by me as a "commute project", with the intention to release it to the world as open sorce. 

The source code and documentation will be made available as soon as I can get my head around and raise it's quality to an acceptable level.

Stay tuned...
